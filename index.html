            <h1>The world through the eyes of teenagers</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">As we, teenagers are sitting in our rooms, as we hear our parents listening to the

            us, did we ever wonder if that darkness had an impact on ourselves? On our feelings? On our daily routine?
            Sometimes, we get bored, we start to do something, we sing, or go for a walk, study, sleep, and sometimes
            write. Write about what we saw, how did we see it? Something we heard; how did we hear it? About a fictional
            love story, we wish experiencing it. About words, we made into a melody. We write, because we can, through
            our writings, modify perceptions, and visions about our surroundings. We write, because this is proof, of

            Thing who’s objective #1 was to bring to light, diverse Lebanese talents, is a glimpse, of our generation’s
            “New York best-sellers”. Close the door, open your eyes, and start reading…
