            <h1>Colorful apogee</h1>
            <p>Once bloomed a beautiful flower,
                In a field under the blue sky.
                A little pearl with much power,
                Giving life to neighboring rye.<br>
                <br>
                She always had one noble dream:
                To fill the valley with her seeds.
                To shine beyond the water stream,
                And get married with the wild reeds.<br>
                <br>
                One day started a storming raid,
                The winds howled, the plants were afraid.
                A flower in a peaceful plain,
                Was bombed by by the merciless rain.<br>
                <br>
                Little did the grey stormy cloud know,
                That you always reap what you sow.
                While the petals were on the ground,
                Seeds were everywhere to be found.<br>
