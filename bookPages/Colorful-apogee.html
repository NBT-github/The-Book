            <h1>Colorful apogee</h1>
            <p>Once bloomed a beautiful flower,
                In a field under the blue sky.
                A little pearl with much power,
                Giving life to neighboring rye. 
                
                She always had one noble dream:
                To fill the valley with her seeds.
                To shine beyond the water stream, 
                And get married with the wild reeds.
                
                One day started a storming raid,
                The winds howled, the plants were afraid. 
                A flower in a peaceful plain,
                Was bombed by by the merciless rain.
                
                Little did the grey stormy cloud know, 
                That you always reap what you sow.
                While the petals were on the ground,
                Seeds were everywhere to be found.
