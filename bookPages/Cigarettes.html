            <h1>Cigarettes</h1>
            <p>Falling for him felt like inhaling a cigarette for the very first time. The idea of him it terrified me, his its poison almost immediately diffused into my lungs. A sudden rush took over me, controlled me, and suddenly he it choked me. The more noxious he it got, the more I became addicted, attached, the harder it became to relinquish him it. <br>
                You see at some point, he it was the only constant in my life which was the reason why I was so dependent on him it. I let out constant painful screams, endless night begging him it to go away, to leave me alone and let me be. But he it never did, he it clung to me, clung to me so tight that even though he it was shortening my breaths I still couldn’t let go. <br>  
                I only realized I had to let him it go when he it actually started to kill me, to shorten my life spawn. He It was killing me so slowly, so damn carefully, strategically, I’m lucky I even realized he it ever was.<br>
                Leaving him it, or trying to quit him it actually, was the hardest shit I ever had to go through. Oh, and relapsing was a must, it happened so many fucking times I lost count. He It took something from me, one thing I’ll never get back.<br>
                You see our entire trale is to only be described as a filthy addiction, nothing more. Poison running through my veins, my lungs for so long I needed him it more than the oxygen my body needed to survive.      <br>
