            <h1>Cigarettes</h1>
            <p>Falling for him felt like inhaling a cigarette for the very first time. The idea of <strike>him</strike> it terrified me,
                <strike>his</strike> its poison almost immediately diffused into my lungs. A sudden rush took over me, controlled me, and
                suddenly <strike>he</strike> it choked me. The more noxious <strike>he</strike> it got, the more I became addicted, attached, the harder
                it became to relinquish <strike>him</strike> it. <br>
                You see at some point, <strike>he</strike> it was the only constant in my life which was the reason why I was so
                dependent on <strike>him</strike> it. I let out constant painful screams, endless night begging <strike>him</strike> it to go away, to
                leave me alone and let me be. But he it never did, he it clung to me, clung to me so tight that even
                though <strike>he</strike> it was shortening my breaths I still couldn’t let go. <br>
                I only realized I had to let him it go when <strike>he</strike> it actually started to kill me, to shorten my life spawn.
                <strike>He</strike> It was killing me so slowly, so damn carefully, strategically, I’m lucky I even realized <strike>he</strike> it ever
                was.<br>
                Leaving <strike>him</strike> it, or trying to quit <strike>him</strike> it actually, was the hardest shit I ever had to go through. Oh,
                and relapsing was a must, it happened so many fucking times I lost count. He It took something from me,
                one thing I’ll never get back.<br>
                You see our entire trale is to only be described as a filthy addiction, nothing more. Poison running
                through my veins, my lungs for so long I needed <strike>him</strike> it more than the oxygen my body needed to survive.
                <br>
