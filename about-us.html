            The Lebanese people have proven over the years that they have a very rich and various amount of talent that
            must be shown to the entire world.
            However, with all the crises happening and the circumstances in Lebanon nowadays, youngsters and their
            talents are getting more and more neglected.
            NEXT BIG THING is a team that first launched in March 2021, in order to help this young generation shine on
            national and international stages.
            To keep up with our work and projects, make sure to visit our Instagram page <a target="_blank" class="blue" href="https://instagram.com/nbt_next.big.thing?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">@nbt_next.big.thing</a> where you
            will find an amazing amount of talents we have been able to reach.
            Our Instagram page has been a platform where young Lebanese share their capabilities but it has also been a
            place from where they could get inspiration and have fun. With games, interviews, podcasts, talk shows and
            competitions we try to provide for this deserving generation an environment which will allow them to
            developpe, share and shine with their talents.
            Moreover, our work is not only online or on social media, as we intend to have offline projects such as
            sports competitions that will also be in favor of this upcoming generation. In addition, we work with
            certain schools to also give their students that chance to shine.
            Do not hesitate and join our family now on Instagram <a class="blue" target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/nbt_next.big.thing?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">@nbt_next.big.thing</a>, or go to the contact us section
